## The Fixer

This utility fixes the issue where 「Ctrl+`」 doesn't work with some CJK keyboards/IMEs in VSCode. 

You may download it directly from the releases page. It's automatically built by Github Actions, so you should not worry about any tampering. 

## Caveats

It works only if the title of VSCode ends with `- Visual Studio Code` or `- VSCode` for some [unsolved issues](https://lanlan.moe/blog/fix-vscode-ctrl-backquote/).
